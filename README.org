#+Title: ArchanoBox-using-SDL2
#+AUTHOR: Kyle Avrett

This is my second ever GitHub repository. It is a re-creation of my first ever repository [[https://github.com/zZelman/ArchanoBox][ArchanoBox]] using SDL2 and raw (and outdated) OpenGL instead of just raw OpenGL. Please refer to [[https://github.com/zZelman/ArchanoBox][ArchanoBox]] for a better description of the project.
